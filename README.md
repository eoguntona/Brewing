# Brewing
Full Stack Final Project

**Project description:**
this is an extension of a project that I did in one of my other classes, which was STRICTLY
design based. I wanted to see if the application that I wanted to make was actually feasible but I started
with user creation, and having individual user logins. Here is the objective of the app:
A timer app for coffee enjoyers, or people who want to 
better handle their time and practice body doubling. 
This app is for people who want to connect with others, 
but have one goal in mind, and that is to 
complete certain tasks within a certain time. 

I called this app brewing, as in brewing coffee, which is to relfect
the process of working or creating something to obtain a certain output.
That the things we make should take time, are to be cultivated, and 
mastered into a process that works best for us. This also recoginizes that 
amny people work better with others around, or having other people work
on a task as well. 

The end goal of this app being, you study a certain amount of time
you get these badges you earn. Each member has a unique barista code, that 
I made very simple, at first it was a UUID v4, and that was too complex for what i needed
and looked very bulky. I digress, with this "Barista ID" you can either join a session
or create a session to join, which allows you to start a joint timer, and if someone exits the app before
the timer is finished then it stops after 5 seconds for both of the users.

**Tech stack**
React
MongoDB
JSX
CSS

**Features**
App registration, and remebered login.
Wanted to flush out the session room feature, 
but felt to complex.

**Setup instructions**
There are pretty minimal set up instructiions in terms of actually logging in.
You just create a user name, password, and enter in your email (it can be a fake one)
and then you get brought to the dashboard. Then once you go to login again then 
you can use the same user name and log in and it will save for you.
